I am currently a Software Developer at [Lemsa Innovation](https://Lemsa Innovation.co/).
I was previously a Jr. Backend Developer at Code and Theory Manila
where I mostly used PHP to create back-end APIs for the front-ends to consume.
Now I am more focused on JavaScript and the front-end side of things
where I am using ReactJS to create beautiful and reusable user interfaces.

## Currently working on

- My personal site [youssoufkacemi.io](/)
- [formik-wizard](https://github.com/dr1tch/formik-wizard): Build multi step forms using Formik and validations.
- [dashooks](https://github.com/dr1tch/dashooks): collection of useful hooks that I've been copying from project to project. Now you can all use it.
- [insuper-ui library](https://github.com/dr1tch/insuper-ui) and [insuper-ui design system on figma](https://dribbble.com/dr1tch/)
